# iNetLogger

iNetLogger is a program written in Java to monitor internet connectivity.

This program will write connection status to a file so they can be further analyzed in the future.

There is a basic GUI interface that is accessed from the System notification area which can be used to:
- Change settings (default and current session)
- Create shortcuts on Windows (startup included)
- Analyze results from the log

Simply download the *.jar* file and run it on your machine. An icon will show up in your system's notification area. The basic GUIs can be accessed by right-clicking on the icon.

This is intended to run consistently in the background and log connection status (primarily to log connection problems to ISP).

Similar preceeding programs:
- internet-connectivity-monitor - Designed more for an on command use (not subtle GUI when logging, logs every log time even when no change in connection status).
- Net Uptime Monitor - Not free
